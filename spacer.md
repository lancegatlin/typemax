## Twiddler: The "Spacer"
To make typing the inside row and furthest pinky key finger (OOOL) effortless, a "spacer" is required. The spacer is a
solid block that widens the gap between the inside of the index finger knuckle and the side of the Twiddler. Expanding
the gap between the index finger knuckle and the Twiddler realigns the fingers in such a way to allow strain-free
typing of inside row and furthest pinky finger key. The size of the spacer will vary according to the user.
