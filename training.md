# Training advice
* Be sure to [fix the strap](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax/blob/master/strap_fix.md) with extra velcro points. The tiny velcro patch at the bottom isn't nearly enough contact to hold the strap in place.
* Use a ["spacer"](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax/blob/master/spacer.md) to fix finger alignment and make typing inside row keys and furthest pinky key strain-free.
* Expect first week to be very frustrating. It feels impossible for awhile.
* Say each letter aloud as you type it everytime you train.
* Use a metronome, pressing keys to beat. Speed up over session. Helps work through memory problems and slow chords. Combine with speaking letter aloud.
* Don't just use Twiddler Tutor. Don't trust its reported WPM. It's overly generous compared to real world results.
* Enable all letters in Tutor settings immediately. Don't let Tutor control when letters get introduced.
* Don't train infrequent MCCs with Tutor. It will cause you to get stuck on a letter repeating it endlessly.
* In Tutor settings, increase lesson length to ensure more 5 letter words show up. This also helps combat over generous WPM reporting by creating more "average" results each time.
