## Overview

Typemax (TMX) is a configuration for single-hand chording keyboards that have a number of keys that is less than the
number of letters in the English alphabet. TMX attempts to maximize the words-per-minute (WPM) typing speed when typing
with only single character chords (i.e. without using multi-character chords (MCC)). Since there are less keys than
letters, many letters are assigned to single key chords (1KC) but other letters must be assigned to two key chords
(2KC). Generally, more frequently used (MFU) letters are assigned to 1KC and less frequently used (LFU) letters are
assigned to 2KC. However, this rule is weighed against a full set of optimizations as outlined below.

| Pros                   | Cons                    |
| ---------------------- | -----------------------:|
| High WPM               | Disables mouse          |
| Often faster than MCC  | Must train "stutter"    |
| Natural type-ability   | Steeper training curve  |
| Intuitive to learn     | Requires "spacer"       |

## Twiddler: The "Spacer"
To make typing the inside row and furthest pinky key finger (OOOL) effortless, a "spacer" is required. The spacer is a
solid block that widens the gap between the inside of the index finger knuckle and the side of the Twiddler. Expanding
the gap between the index finger knuckle and the Twiddler realigns the fingers in such a way to allow strain-free
typing of inside row and furthest pinky finger key. The size of the spacer will vary according to the user.

Note: Twiddler configuration requires firmware 15+
